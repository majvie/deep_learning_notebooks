## fish classification using CNNs

fish_classification - This project involves using CNNs and PyTorch to classify fish images into different categories. We will train a model on a dataset of fish images and use it to predict the class of new, unseen images. Finally its performance is compared to a fine-tuned AlexNet and a MobileNet to explore Transfer Learning.

## detecting sailboats at sea

object_detection - A Faster R-CNN is trained to detect and categorize maritime objects, such as sailboats and buoys, at sea. Each detection is visualised with a bounding box and relevant metrics are displayed next to the image category. For this purpose images are filtered from the Pascal VOC for training.

## MNIST classification using MLPs and pytorch

mnist_class- This project involves using MLPs and PyTorch to classify handwritten letters from the MNIST dataset.
